Title: Implementing and Evaluating the ZX-Calculus Quantum Optimization Method for the Grover’s, QFT, QAOA, and Quantum Teleportation Algorithms

Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is considered to be a promising approach for creating practical quantum computers. This project focuses on implementing the ZX-calculus optimization technique for measurement-based quantum circuits and evaluating its effectiveness by comparing the performance of four established quantum circuits before and after applying ZX-calculus. The quantum algorithms that were selected for this project address Grover’s unstructured search, the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and quantum teleportation. This project also implements the selected algorithms, as well as transpiler pipeline optimization features from IBM’s Qiskit software. Implemented circuits and optimization techniques were evaluated by running application experiments on the Brisbane QPU provided by the IBM Quantum Platform. 

Fall 2025:

Goal: To build a collection of random circuits to which genetic programming in regards to ZX-calculus can be applied. Emphasis is placed on compiling data for which ZX-calculus methods resulted in the greatest circuit reduction for circuits of all sizes and gates.
