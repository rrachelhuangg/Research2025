- [x] Get Qiskit set up locally
- [ ] Implement a generic version of Grover's algorithm for testing/understanding it (Qiskit API and gfg implementation)
  - [ ] Use official API docs for Grover's operator and phase oracle to implement the working test from gfg
  - [ ] Modify implementation based on specific project specs

-----------------------------------------------

- [ ] Implement Shor's algorithm
- [ ] Implement Grover's algorithm
- [ ] Implement QFT algorithm
- [ ] Implement selected quantum teleportation algorithm
- [ ] Implement ZX-optimization for a basic circuit
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Implement tests for checking if optimized circuits and original circuits still have the same functionality

- [ ] Pass the test for this certificate [IBM Qiskit Certificate](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/ibm-certified-associate-developer-quantum-computation-using-qiskit-v02x-C0010300) probably around when this project
is close to being completed
