- [x] Get Qiskit set up locally
- [x] Implement a generic version of Grover's algorithm for testing/understanding it
  - [ ] Modify implementation based on specific project specs
- [ ] Figure out what type of problem to apply these circuits to (just searching for a marked state or something a little more complex)

-----------------------------------------------

- [ ] Implement Shor's algorithm
- [ ] Implement Grover's algorithm
- [ ] Implement QFT algorithm
- [ ] Implement selected quantum teleportation algorithm
- [ ] Implement ZX-optimization for a basic circuit
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Implement tests for checking if optimized circuits and original circuits still have the same functionality

- [ ] Pass the test for this certificate [IBM Qiskit Certificate](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/ibm-certified-associate-developer-quantum-computation-using-qiskit-v02x-C0010300) probably around when this project
is close to being completed
