- [x] Get Qiskit set up locally
- [ ] Implement a base version of Grover's algorithm for testing/understanding it (Qiskit API and gfg implementation)
  - [ ] Figure out what implementations have in common
  - [ ] Use official API documentation for Grover's operator and phase oracle to implement the working test from gfg


- [ ] Implement Shor's algorithm
- [ ] Implement Grover's algorithm
- [ ] Implement QFT algorithm
- [ ] Implement selected quantum teleportation algorithm


- [ ] Pass the test for this certificate [IBM Qiskit Certificate](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/ibm-certified-associate-developer-quantum-computation-using-qiskit-v02x-C0010300) probably around when this project
is close to being completed
