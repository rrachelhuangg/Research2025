- [x] Get Qiskit set up locally
- [x] Implement a generic version of Grover's algorithm for testing/understanding it
  - [x] Modify implementation based on specific project specs
  - [x] Make it configurable and try different options
- [x] Figure out what type of problem to apply these circuits to (just searching for a marked state or something more complex)
- [x] Implement Shor's algorithm

- [x] Implemented one-state quantum teleportation with 3 qubits
- [x] Applied ZX-calculus to teleportation circuit
- [x] Verified that teleportation circuit functionality was the same before and after applying zx-calculus

-----------------------------------------------

- [ ] Implement QFT algorithm
- [ ] Buff up all four circuits for ZX-calculus testing (the different test groups for each circuit and a control)
- [ ] Apply ZX-calculus to all circuits
- [ ] Try out different ZX-calculus optimization techniques
- [ ] Calculate difference in gates before and after ZX-calculus optimization
- [ ] Try running smallest working circuit on IBM hardware
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Implement tests for checking if optimized circuits and original circuits still have the same functionality

- [ ] Pass the test for this certificate [IBM Qiskit Certificate](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/ibm-certified-associate-developer-quantum-computation-using-qiskit-v02x-C0010300) probably around when this project
is close to being completed
